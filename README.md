I evaluated the logistic regression classifier for this ML trading algorithm. In backtesting its performance, it was clear that this model did not perform as well (as a whole). If the backtesting stopped in 2020, I would have said that the modified algorithm significantly outperformed the original algo. However, there was significant underperformance in the latter half of 2020 and the beginning of 2021 that completely negated it's outperformance up until that period. For this reason, I have reason to suspect that the modified algo's future performance will be more volatile and not in the best interest of investors. Sharp declines such as the one seen in the latter half of 2020 are unnacceptable in the financial space, especially since the overall economy began to improve during this time period.
